# Reliance Express

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# Component - the project has six components for managing their own state and properties, 
allowing for efficient development and maintenance.

# State Management-The project states ensure the synchronization of data and UI, leading 
to a desire expectable application.

# Event Handling - use a handle events (onClick) efficiently within components. It 
facilitates interactions and enables the triggering of actions based on input.

# Component State (useState hook):

# The useState hook is a built-in React hook that allows functional components to have 
local state.It initializes and updates state within a functional component and .

# useLoader:
# A hook to load data with an arbitrary THREE loader class. The result of load is cached 
and subsequent calls with the same arguments will yield the same return value (i.e. the 
same reference) across the entire Threlte app. The hook can use async loaders (using 
loader).
